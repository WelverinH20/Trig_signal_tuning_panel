Interactive Wave Matching Panel 
A hands-on, interactive panel designed to provide a fun and intuitive way to understand properties of waves. Users manipulate a signal's frequency and amplitude to match a target wave, receiving real-time visual feedback on their progress.

How It Works
Goal: make your wave look exactly like the target wave.

Dual Screens: The panel features two displays. One screen shows a pre-set "target" wave, while the second screen shows the "user" wave that you control.

Interactive Controls: Two potentiometers allow you to modify your wave in real-time. One adjusting frequency, the other adjusting amplitude

Progress Feedback: As your wave gets closer to matching the target, a physical LED progress gauge on the panel begins to fill up.

Mission Complete: Once your wave's parameters perfectly align with the target's, the LED gauge will be completely full, signaling that you've successfully tuned the signal!

Key Features
Hands-On Learning: Offers a tangible and engaging way to visualize how frequency and amplitude changes affect a wave's shape.

Real-Time Visuals: See the immediate impact of your adjustments on the user wave display.

Scalable Difficulty: The challenge can easily be increased for more advanced users, as different types of waves can be presented. Also, the target wave can be programmed to slowly change its frequency or amplitude, requiring the user to continuously adapt.
